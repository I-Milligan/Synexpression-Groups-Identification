## Introduction

Synexpression Groups (SGs) consist of genes that are involved in the same biological processes with shared complex regulation of expression that are in proximity spatially. However, the ability to predict gene co-expression from frequent remote chromatin interactions is difficult, even though there is a correlation between chromatin interactions and gene co-expression. There is increasing evidence that suggest these SGs are vital components of the complex multicellular matrix of all biological species.  Nonetheless, there has been little systemic genome-wide research into SGs; the exact means to which they are regulated, their cluster frequency and how widespread they occur within the genome remains unclear.
