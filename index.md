## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/I-Milligan/Synexpression-groups-identification/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```IPython Notebook
# Import external data
# convert data type

# Mapping ENSEMBL back to GENE name to help label and search operations 
gene_mapping = rawdata
gene_mapping.index = gene_mapping['ENSEMBL']
gene_mapping = gene_mapping[gene_mapping.columns[1:2]]
gene_mapping = gene_mapping.fillna(0)

# now loop through the mapping and convert any gene names = 0 to the ensemble
for row_num, value in enumerate(gene_mapping.index.values):
    if(gene_mapping.iloc[row_num][0]==0):
        gene_mapping.iloc[row_num,0] = value 
    
# set index
rawdata.index = rawdata['ENSEMBL'] 
rawdata = rawdata.drop(['ENSEMBL','gene','name'], axis=1)

# Have to drop Rows where the Gene name aka(index) is Blank
# data = data.loc[data.index.dropna(how='all')]
# To Follow Spactial DB we convert NaN to 0
rawdata = rawdata.fillna(0)

# need to capture row 0 into a list for mapping later as column names
section_map = rawdata.columns.tolist()
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/I-Milligan/Synexpression-groups-identification/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
